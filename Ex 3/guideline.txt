Exercise : Regime-swifting models II

Using data from the base_bond-equity database, we wish to
study the relationships between the bond spreads of two countries (10-year yields). Choose one of
the following country pairs (Let's go with autria & spain):

1: France/Belgium; 2 : Austria/Spain; 3: Greece/Ireland; 4: Italy/the Netherlands

Consider the following equation:

(𝑌𝑖𝑡) − 𝑌𝑔𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽𝑖𝑗(𝐿)[(𝑌𝑗𝑡) − 𝑌𝑔𝑡] + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡
𝑌𝑔𝑡: German 10-year bond
(𝑌𝑖𝑡) − 𝑌𝑔𝑡: yield spread of country i
(𝑌𝑗𝑡) − 𝑌𝑔𝑡: yield spread of country j
L is the lag operator and 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 is a white noise term.

Questions
1. Estimate the above equation using a Markov-switching model with 2 regimes:
- Estimate the linear model and use tests on residuals to show that the dynamics is probably
nonlinear.
- Fit a Markov-switching model (select the optimal lag structure using tests based on
information criteria).
- Plot graphs of the posterior probabilities of each regime
- Comment your findings.
2. We wish to apply a STAR model to the excess return on assets, the transition variable being
the market excess return delayed by one or more periods (to be determined). After applying
the appropriate tests, estimate an ESTAR or LSTAR model. Make a graphical
representation of the transition function. Comment on your results.
3. Use a bivariate GARCH model to study the correlation between excess return of your assets
and excess return on the market. Comment on your results
