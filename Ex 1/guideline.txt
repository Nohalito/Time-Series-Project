Exercise 1: Extreme distributions
• Download the Excel file CAPM on AMETICE
• Consider the following indexes : Microsoft
NB: USTB3M is the yield of the risk-free asset (3-month US government Bond Yield) and
S&P500 is the market index.
• Do a preliminary analysis of the excess returns (your asset + market excess returns) based
on basics statistics, graphs of the distributions, QQ-plots, box-plot, bivariate scatterplot,
graphs of time series, autocorrelation function, pp-plot
• Fit one of the following extreme distribution to the excess returns (your asset + market
excess returns): Weibull, log-normal, Gamma.
• Fit a GEV distribution to the excess return series and plot the QQ-plot, density and CDF.
• Using elliptical copulas, estimate the correlation between the excess returns of your asset
asset and the market excess returns.
• Fit Archimedian copulas (Clayton or Weibull).
