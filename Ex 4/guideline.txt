Exercise 4 : Extreme distributions :

Now, we wish to model the correlation between the spreads of countries Autstria and Spain using copulas.
• Do a preliminary analysis of the spreads based on basics statistics, graphs of the
distributions, QQ-plots, box-plot, bivariate scatterplot, graphs of time series,
autocorrelation function, pp-plot
• Fit one of the following extreme distribution to the spreads: Weibull, log-norma, Gamma.
• Fit a GEV distribution to the excess return series and plot the QQ-plot, density and CDF.
• Using elliptical copulas, estimate the correlation between the excess returns of your asset
asset and the market excess returns.
• Fit Archimedian copulas (Clayton or Weibull).
